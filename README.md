Fully working, Undetected AK-47 Macro for Rust.  (Only supports Logitech Devices ) 


- Created and Maintained by xM-1 

Installation : 

1. Ensure you have Logitech G-Hub installed and updated to the latest version. 
2. Use the  default profile on your mouse. The one that says Desktop and create a script. 
3. Paste this Lua into the script popup. 
4. Go to where it says "local AK47 = nil" and "local AK47_X8_SCOPE = nil", the nil is where you need to setup your binds.  
5. Set your binds on your mouse. It is a one click activation and deactivation so make sure to use your side mouse buttons. Eg. Mouse 4, Mouse 5 (For mouse 4 we would put in "4" instead of Nil and so on). 
6. Save the script 
7. Keep G-Hub running and launch your game, press your bind once to activate it and once more to deactivate it. One of your binds is for x8 Scope and the other is for no scope / handmade, feel free to also use laser or flashlight.

Set in game Sensitivity to .8 or .7, whichever works best and FOV to 90. Change them as you please until you get a smoother spray. This won't fully eliminate recoil but if you can control what's left over, you'll do just fine.
